    <p>In September, I will start my PhD here at the University of Manchester, which will explore how people represent and interpret data visualisations. Over the last year, the MRes Psychology programme has given me opportunities to practice a variety of new skills and has provided me with a good foundation for my future studies.</p>
<p>The ‘Advanced Data Skills, Open Science and Reproducibility’ and ‘Advanced Statistics Workshop’ modules taught me about the assumptions behind statistical modelling techniques, and also provided useful maxims for navigating the complex world of analysis. In particular, the quote “<em>all models are wrong, but some are useful</em>” (George Box) is one phrase that sticks in my mind!</p>
<p><img src="/img/gbox.jpg" alt="George Box"></p>
<p>Developing my own analysis scripts for the assignments in these modules pushed me to explore different analysis methods, and also led me to discover valuable tools recently released by developers around the world. Hands-on practice improved my ability to find effective solutions to problems in my code, which will undoubtedly save me time during my PhD.</p>
<p>In addition, I also wrote the programme for my dissertation project experiment. Despite using a different programming language to that used for statistical analysis, I wouldn’t have been able to approach this without the background and coding experience I gained from these modules.</p>
<p>Quantitative psychology underpins my dissertation project and general research interests, so I was initially unsure how useful I would find the Qualitative Research Methods module. However, the assignments for this unit were ultimately beneficial for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Qualitative analysis often involves considering many detailed observations and reducing these into a comprehensible argument. This is similar to the process of writing and selecting information for a literature review. Experience in extracting key information, recognising relationships between concepts, and considering the ordering of points are relevant skills for discussing ideas in any discipline of psychology.</p>
<p>In addition, these written assignments provided good opportunities for tackling tight word counts. I practiced continuous editing and concise writing to avoid removing important content.</p>
<p>For me, the most valuable aspects of the Psychology MRes course have been what have I learnt through working on the assignments. This independent study has encouraged me to apply methods covered in classes, and also engage in wider reading to explore new, advanced techniques.</p>
